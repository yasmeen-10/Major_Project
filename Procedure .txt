Firstly we took some datasets from google and then inserted them into jupyter notebook.
Then we installed the required libraries and implemented the algorithms one by one
i.e - Firstly we implemented the Linear Regression Algorithm and checked the accuracy for that.
It gave 78.33%.
Then Support Vector Machine gave 70.23%.
Random Forest Regression gave 79.00%.
Gradient Boosting Algorithm gave 81.01%.
And XG Boost extreme Grading Boosting Algorithm gave 95%.
After comparison of all this we got the best accuracy for XG Boost extreme Grading Boosting Algorithm.
